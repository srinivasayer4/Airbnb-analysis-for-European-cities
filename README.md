# Airbnb-analysis-for-European-cities
# Installation
This code is written in a Jupyter notebook and is coded in Python 3. I have used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, os, re (for regex) and sklearn libraries to complete the project. Hence, these need to be installed.

# Project Motivation
In this project I have analyzed the Airbnb listings across various European cities and compared different characterstics of these listings. I have used the Airbnb data from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The cities that I have taken for my analysis are Amsterdam (Netherlands), Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), Lisbon (Portugal), Madrid (Spain), Paris (France), Rome (Italy) and London (UK).
The key questions that I wanted to explore are-
1) How does the price change across various European cities.
2) Are there different property types(apartments/ townshouses) that are more popular in certain countries.
3) How responsive are the hosts to customer queries?
4) Is there a relationship between the how fast hosts respond and their acceptance rates?
5) Do people prefer to rent a single room or the entire house? How does it vary across the countries.
6) Can one predict the price of a listing based on the other features like location, amenities etc.?

# File Description
There is a Jupyter notebook in .ipynb format. I will also be writing a blogpost on Medium summarizing all the insights that I gather. I will upload the blogpost in the form of a word file here.

# Licensing and Acknoledgements
The data has been obtained from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/about.html). You can find the data licensing details on their page http://insideairbnb.com/behind.html. Feel free to use the code in the Jupyter notebook as you like.
